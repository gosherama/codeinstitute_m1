### 1.Project Overview

### 7.Testing
- convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well.
- go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

- Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

- For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

- You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

### 8.Deployment
- describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku)
- In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
---> run code locally using live server from within vscode.
